        <h2>Who I am ?</h2>
        <p>My name is Justine Sans-Rippol, I come from the south between Bordeaux and Toulouse or more precisely in Houeillès.It is a small village of 600 inhabitants in the Lot et Garonne. Since I was a little girl, I have always loved village festivals, which I find to be unique, joyful and full of conviviality. The south is a bit like a big house, even if you don't know each other, when you hear the accent you know where the person comes from and it becomes an exciting moment.</p>
		


        <h2>My schooling</h2>
		<p>I spent all my schooling from kindergarten to high school in the south. My secondary school is located ten minutes from my village, in Casteljaloux, and my high school is an hour from my home, in Agen. Even if I had the possibility to go to a closer school, I chose this one because of the music option they offer.
		As it was not possible to go back and forth every day, I became an intern. I stayed at the school from Monday to Friday. It was an advantage to be able to get up only at seven o'clock while others were getting up much earlier.</br>
		In high school, I did a "bac STMG" where I was able to learn economics, management and law, while having the music option. Thanks to the latter, I was able to go on trips, such as to Rome in Italy in 2018 and to Prague in the Czech Republic in 2019. It was an incredible experience, with buildings and another culture and also because we had to travel by bus... </br>
		After passing my baccalaureate, I was accepted in the IUT of Blois in Networks and Telecommunications. Even if it meant moving more than 500 kilometres from home, I took the risk. As the town is the same size as Agen, I wasn't too scared.</p>
