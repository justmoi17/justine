<h2>Professional project</h2>
<p>I chose this field of study following my 3rd year internship at the Essonne Departmental Security. I discovered the different brigades and in particular that of cyber security.</br>
At the end of my BUT, if I have the ability and the desire, I will continue my studies in an engineering school. But I am also hesitating to join the army, which offers training to become a cyber security expert.</p>
<p>The cyber security expert is the person in charge of all online security for an organisation or company. His or her role is to track down security flaws in Internet and intranet networks to secure data exchanges. It must assess whether the sites to be consulted are reliable. It then searches for possible viruses and removes any attempt at intrusion by hackers.</p>
